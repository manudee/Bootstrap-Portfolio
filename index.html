			<p class="pc">Thanks for visiting my page! Let me give you some background about me. I work as a Test Engine-er with a financial firm. It's been 7 long years so far.</p>
			<p class="pc">I have had a chance to work on different technologies and applications ranging from a desktop application, backend data warehouses (Analytical as well as Operational, UI and web services APIs(REST and SOAP).
			During my initial years in the QA, I was mainly working with manual testing however with recent technological changes and things like protractor, node js - I have shifted my focus on automation testing. It's been an interesting so far gaining experience with node modules, new backend DBs like cassandra and running a complete E2E test using the jasmine framework. 
			I am also getting a chance to implement CI/CD at work for an application that is being migrated to AWS. It's going to be a challenge and a lot of new learnings along the way. Keep checking my page for more progress more on those!!
